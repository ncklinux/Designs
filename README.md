# Designs

Highlighting my innovative design works and visual communication to engage, inspire, and connect with the creative community

## Motivation

Every design starts as a simple idea, a spark of imagination waiting to be brought to life. Creativity isn’t about perfection — it’s about expression, exploration, and daring to try something new. Each project completed, no matter how big or small, is a step forward on the journey of growth and mastery :wink:

When challenges arise, I see them as opportunities to learn and innovate. A unique perspective is the greatest strength. Keep pushing boundaries, stay curious, and never stop believing in the power of vision. The world needs creativity — so keep designing, keep dreaming, and keep shining!

## Software

My creative workflow began in BSD and GNU/Linux environments, with a strong emphasis on open-source and cross-platform design tools. Inkscape and GIMP have served as my primary applications for vector and raster graphics, respectively. For collaborative and web-based projects, I regularly use Figma, Penpot, and Corel Vector (formerly Gravit Designer).

I have also gained valuable experience with Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop during opportunities to explore diverse design ecosystems on macOS.
